# Heart Attack Prediction Project


## Overview:

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, with heart attacks being one of the most common and fatal outcomes. This project aims to build a predictive model using Python and R to estimate the likelihood of a heart attack based on various health-related factors. The Random Forest Classifier, a powerful ensemble learning method, is employed as the primary algorithm for making these predictions.

## Objectives:

1. To predict the likelihood of heart attacks using patient health data.
2. To compare and evaluate different machine learning models, focusing on Random Forest Classifier.
3. To assess feature importance and provide insights into which factors contribute most to heart attack risks.

## Data Source:

The dataset for this project is derived from CFC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in America which contains information about factors that might be directly or indirectly related to heart diseases. The dataset comprises 40 columns and 445132 rows in total. The link to the dataset is as follows: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease
